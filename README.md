Difference between Callbacks and Promises??
State Management
Callbacks:
Callbacks do not have a built-in mechanism to track the state of an asynchronous operation (e.g., pending, fulfilled, or rejected).
Promises:
Promises have three states:
Pending: The initial state (operation not yet completed).
Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
Rejected: The operation failed.
